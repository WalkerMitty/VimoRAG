# Pre-released VimoRAG
This is an anonymous repository. We will be releasing the HcVD database soon, along with the complete codes (pre-trained models). Please stay in tuned~


### ðŸ‘€ Some zero-shot visualization results
The following results are obtained on the IDEA400 test set, while our model is trained solely on the HumanML3D training set.
